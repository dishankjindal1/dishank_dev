# dart-backend

- As the name is self explanatory, I am using dart client-optimized programming language to write code to create API so that front-end can talk with the backend resources.

## My Beliefs

- I have a bais for the dart language as it can truly become the language which can help full-stack developer to bring out the best.

- Another reason, Javascript is very popular but has carried forward some flaws with it. And due to its wide adoption, those change are being carried forward to new versions and fixing is becoming next to impossible.

- Mircosoft came up with TypeScript a superset of javascript, they avoided javascript mistakes by smart workarounds, instead of getting it FIXED.

- In my opinion, Dart is good becuase it shits Machine code because of it AOT compilation. Which is a goody-goody to me at least. It has a runtime which is not significant for most day to day enterprise operations.

- If you want to make games, or software like photoshop, etc. Then i would still not bet on dart. !Some folds had proved me wrong already, for ex company like RIVE who is alternative to Adobe suite.

- **FUTURE IS LOOKING BRIGHT OF DART**
